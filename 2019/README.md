# BDPA National HSCC 2019 Problem Statement

This was not the 2019 problem statement issued during the 2019 national
competition, but it is very similar. It has been retrofitted to conform with the
new competition format and is suitable for teams to train with for future
competitions.

Included in this directory are `example-design-docs/`, which will give you a
feel for how a team might plan to complete this problem statement, as well as a
PHP-based example of an [Instant-Runoff
Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting) implementation.
