# BDPA National HSCC 2019 Problem Statement

This was not the problem statement issued during the 2019 competition, but it is
very similar. It has been retrofitted to conform with the new competition format
and is suitable for teams to train with for future competitions.

Included in this directory is `example-design-docs/`, which will give you a feel
for how a team might plan to complete this problem statement. Additionally, we
include a PHP-based example of an [Instant-Runoff
Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting) implementation.

The demo implementation of this solution can be found
[here](https://github.com/nhscc/2019.solutions.hscc.bdpa.org).

The API implementation used for this problem statement can be found
