# BDPA National HSCC 2019 Problem Statement

This was not the 2019 problem statement issued during the 2019 competition, but
it is very similar. It has been retrofitted to conform with the new competition
format and is suitable for teams to train with for future competitions.

Included in this directory is `example-design-docs/`, which will give you a feel
for how a team might plan to complete this problem statement. These were the
designs used to build out the [demo
implementation](https://github.com/nhscc/2019.solutions.hscc.bdpa.org).
Additionally, we include a PHP-based example of an [Instant-Runoff
Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting) implementation.

The implementation of the Elections API can be found
[here](https://github.com/nhscc/elections.api.hscc.bdpa.org).
